# 🎤  Spotify Lyrics

🎧 🎹 Show currently playing song and its lyrics 🎸 🪕

A **Next.js** application that connects to your Spotify account to display your currently playing song and its lyrics.

## Background

Unlike its mobile app, the Spotify web application (as of May 4, 2020) does not have the ability to display lyrical information for a currently playing song. So I created **Spotify Lyrics** to achieve this.

But please note that my app does not have full functionalities like the actual Spotify web application. It might not be a good idea if you're looking to rely on this as your actual Spotify web player 🤹‍♂️.

## Architecture

Next.js (powered by React), Axios, Cheerio (scraping Genius website)
